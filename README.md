# Mustache.NETStandard & Mustache.PCL - Logic-less templates for .NET 

These libraries are implementations of Mustache logic-less templates specifications.

This fork allows modifications to allow the .NET version to mimic the same capabilties for Mustache that exist in javascript only.  Some of the features and capabilities available in the javascript mustache library were not implemented and also were not part of the original specification.   I tried to get these changes merged back into the main branch but was unsuccessful in talking the branch owner into it because they are not in the specifications.

Mustache.NETStandard is a .NETStandard Class Library for .NETStandard 2.0.

Mustache.PCL is a .NET Portable Class Library for
- .NET Framework 4.6
- ASP.NET Core 1.0
- Windows Universal 10.0
